    Recursion:
         It is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
    Advantages of recursion:
        A complicated function can be split down into smaller sub-problems utilizing recursion.
        Sequence creation is simpler through recursion than utilizing any nested iteration.
        Recursive functions render the code look simple and effective.
    Disadvantages of recursion:
        A lot of memory and time is taken through recursive calls which makes it expensive for use.
        Recursive functions are challenging to debug.
        The reasoning behind recursion can sometimes be tough to think through.
    Syntax:
        def func(): <--
                        |
                        | (recursive call)
                        |
            func() ----
