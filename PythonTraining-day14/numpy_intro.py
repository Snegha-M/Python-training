Numpy:
    NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
    It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
    NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
    NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
    The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
    NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists,
    so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
