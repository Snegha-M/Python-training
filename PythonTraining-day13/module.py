Time Module:
    Python has a module named time to handle time-related tasks.
    To use functions defined in the module, we need to import the module first.
Calendar Module:
    The calendar module allows output calendars like the program and provides additional useful functions
    related to the calendar. Functions and classes defined in the Calendar module use an idealized calendar,
    the current Gregorian calendar extended indefinitely in both directions.
    By default, these calendars have Monday as the first day of the week,
    and Sunday as the last (the European convention).
Date and Time Module:
    In Python, date and time are not a data type of their own,
    but a module named datetime can be imported to work with the date as well as time.
