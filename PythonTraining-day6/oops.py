    2.Object
        The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. 
        It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.    
    An object consists of :
        State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
        Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
        Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

    6.Abstraction
        Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. 
        The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. 
        User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."
